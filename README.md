# Jexi

Hello Everyone,

I have created a Personal Assistant named 'Jexi' using core concepts of python after attending "Specialist in Python" training. It is an initiative by IIEC Rise. In just 4 classes I have developed a program where I can give instructions by typing and python will do that task.

Functions of Jexi:

1) She gives Responses by Audio Feedback.

2) You can interact with assistant with commands like Hi, Hello, and can ask her name.

3) She Greets you based on the time of the day.

4) She Can open various System apps like Chrome, Notepad, Word pad, calculator, outlook etc.

5) She can do a google Searches

6) She can open various Websites.

Advantages of Jexi:

1) Jexi Provides more Human like response.

2) Code for Jexi is divided in Various Well Commented Functions for easy navigation.

3) I have Used List of Keywords to define various tasks like (chrome,notepad,explorer...)
(YouTube,amazon,gmail,Facebook,...)
for easy expansion of tasks in future

4) While opening a website Jexi Automatically opens it in HTTPS mode which is more secure compared to HTTP.
